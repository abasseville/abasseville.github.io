			<h2> 1. PredAlgoBC (predictive algorithm for breast cancer therapy)</h2>
			<br>			
			<p>PredAlgoBC is a project funded by a grant from the European Commission Horizon 2020 program 
			(Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action). It is a project dedicated to the search of biomarkers to develop personalized medicine. </p><br>
			<p>
			Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, mainly due to treatment resistance in metastatic cancers. Some patients are diagnosed with 
			de novo metastatic cancers, but majorities of metastatic breast cancers are evolutions of the initial disease following treatment failure. Heterogeneity 
			in components forming tumor microenvironment (TME) is now considered as one of the major causes of treatment resistance. Indeed, TME is inextricably involved 
			in cancer progression - from carcinoma in situ to local invasion and dissemination - and variation in the expression of several of its components have been 
			associated with breast cancer recurrence. TME composition varies strongly between patients, advocating for more personalized approaches in treatment, 
			and these approaches require new biomarkers to assess more accurately the biology of each tumor.</p>
			<p>Biomarker search is a challenging field requiring sophisticated mathematical approaches combined with biological deep analysis.One of the methodological 
			approaches used is supervised learning, which consists in building a mathematical model based on the selection of important genes among the multitude of 
			existing genes in order to predict a phenotype (in this case, the response to treatment). To do this, the algorithms are trained on a sufficiently large 
			number of patients for whom the transcriptome of the tumor is known, as well as the associated response to treatment. Once the predictive model has been 
			established by training, it can be applied to new data to predict the unknown treatment response (see Figure). In transcriptomics, the task is particularly 
			challenging because the number of genes (10,000-20,000) far exceeds the number of patients (on average about 100 per study).</p>
			<p>The EU-funded PredAlgoBC project mains to search for predictive biomarkers by implementing a supervised machine learning analysis taking into account the 
			challenges using merged transcriptomics datasets selected from public databases.Eventually, the identification of new biomarkers and their implementation 
			in the clinic will guide clinicians in the selection of the optimal therapeutic option.
