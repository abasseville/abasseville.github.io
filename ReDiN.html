			Breast cancer is the most deadly cancer among women, mainly due to resistance to treatments. One strategy to reduce recurrence is personalized medicine. Since each tumor is unique, 
			it is essential to assign each patient the treatment best suited to the characteristics of their tumor. To this end, it is possible to develop predictive models of treatment response 
			based on omics data from the tumor. However, processing this type of data, which is complex and suffers from the curse of dimensionality, requires the development of more suitable approaches. 
			With that purpose, diverse mathematical-oriented strategies can be implemented. Here, a binary classifier was built from the dual formulation of the Wasserstein distance between the data distributions of each class, 
			as were its regularized versions and its deep learning counterpart. These methods proved to be suitable for processing the tested data, especially when the predictive information is spread across many variables.
