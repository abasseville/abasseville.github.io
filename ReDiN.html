			<h2>1. HABiC (Hungarian Algorithm for Binary Classification)</h2>

			Machine learning classification is a well-established discipline whose algorithms have shown excellent performances in many fields. In healthcare, they are currently being developed 
			to improve precision medicine, and are already used in the clinic to stratify patient from medical images. Nevertheless, and despite the clinical need, classification models based 
			on molecular omics data are not currently applicable in the clinic due to their poor performances linked to high dimensionality and data structure inherent to omics data. 
			In this particular area, new strategies are still required to improve classification methods.
            </p>
			<p> We tested two new strategies to build an algorithm that improves transcriptomics-based classification models. Firstly, we used as a metric the Wasserstein distance 
			derived from optimal transport instead of the commonly used Euclidean distance. The Wasserstein distance has gained popularity with omics data in recent years, 
			but no Wasserstein-based classifier has been developed for omics data yet. Secondly, our algorithm computes the exact Wasserstein distance (or more precisely the optimizer related 
			to the 1-Wasserstein distance) instead of a distance approximation typically performed using a neural network. The use of an exact algorithm allows to increase model precision 
			while avoiding complex approximation steps and optimization pitfalls. Exact methods are not generally used due to their high computational cost for large sample sizes, 
			but omics data, with their small sample sizes, allow the use of an algorithm in O(n3) time, turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Compared to the state-of-the-art 
			classification algorithms, our algorithm is faster to run since there are no hyperparameter tuning steps. We also observed that it was best suited when class information 
			was shared between a large number of informative variables.
