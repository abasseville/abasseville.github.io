			<p>ReDin (Reductive Discriminating Network) is a project awarded by the Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, and led by Chiara Cordier, PhD student. </p><br>
			<p>   <!-- n&lt; replaces the "<"  &gt; replaces the ">"   -->
			In this project, we aim to develop deep learning algorithms to predict treatment response in breast cancer using transcriptomic data. One of the biggest 
			issues when using predictive algorithms with health data is the curse of dimensionality: the number of features (genes) is too high compared to number of 
			observation (patient samples). In this setting (n&lt;&lt;p), algorithm performances are generally not good enough for a clinical use.</p>
			<p>To deal with these difficulties, our first approach will be to generate virtual patient transcriptomic data thanks to a deep learning algorithm named GAN 
			(Generative Adversarial Network), that has been first developed by Goodfellow et al. (2014) to create highly realistic pictures of non-existent people. We will 
			used an alternative version of GAN named Wasserstein GAN or WGAN (Arjovsky et al, 2017).</p><br>
			<p>The second considered solution will be to reduce the number of features without losing relevant information provided by them. To this end, we were inspired 
			by WGAN process (two neural networks learning simultaneously) to develop a new algorithm that we named Reductive Discriminating Network (ReDiN). In ReDin, one 
			of the networks aims to reduce data dimension while the other one assigns a score to each reduced data in order to evaluate its class. Both networks are then 
			optimized to maximize the Wasserstein distance (estimated using the scores assigned by the second network) between distributions of the two class-split reduced groups.
